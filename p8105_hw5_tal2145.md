## Problem 1

-----

**Loading in `iris` dataset with missing values**

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

#### Writing a function to replace missing values

  - missing numeric values are filled in with the mean of non-missing
    values
  - missing character values are filled in with \`“virginica”

<!-- end list -->

``` r
fix_missing = function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  } else if (is.character(x)) {
  replace_na(x, "virginica")
  }
}

iris_no_missing = map_dfr(iris_with_missing, fix_missing)
```

## Problem 2

-----

#### Part 1: Loading and tidying control and experimental arm data\*\*

  - reading in all files from each subject into one dataframe
  - tidying data to include 4 columns with study arm, id, week and

<!-- end list -->

``` r
read_files = function(file) {
  study_data = read_csv(file)
}

path_base = "./data/"

study_data = 
  tibble(
    file_name = list.files(path = "./data/"),
    all_files = str_c(path_base, file_name)) %>% 
  mutate(study_data = map(all_files, read_files)) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  select(-all_files) %>% 
  separate(file_name, into = c("study_arm", "subject_id"), sep = "\\_") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8, 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "observation"
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    subject_id = str_replace(subject_id, ".csv", ""),
    week = str_replace(week, "week_", ""),
    study_arm = str_replace(study_arm, "con", "control"),
    study_arm = str_replace(study_arm, "exp", "experimental")
)
```

#### Part 2: Making a spaghetti plot showing observations over time and differences between study arms

``` r
study_data %>% 
  group_by(study_arm, subject_id) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, color = study_arm, group = interaction(study_arm, subject_id))) +
  #geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
    labs(
   title = "Subject Observations Over Time",
   x = "Week",
   y = "Observation"
  ) 
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_tal2145_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="90%" />

Looking at the spaghetti plot where yellow represents the experimental
arm and purple represents the control arm, we see that the values of
weekly observations for the experimental subjects is higher on average
than that of the control arm. There appears to be a positive trend in
observation value and increasing week of observation among the
experimental subjects. At the end of the observed time, all participants
in the experimental arm have higher observation values than all of the
controls.

## Problem 3

-----

#### Part 1:

``` r
set.seed(1)

sim_regression = function(n, beta0 = 2, beta1 = 0) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 50),
    y = beta0 + beta1 * x + rnorm(n, 0, 1)
  )
  
  ls_fit = lm(y ~ x, data = sim_data)
  
  tibble(
    beta0_hat = coef(ls_fit)[1],
    beta1_hat = coef(ls_fit)[2]
  )
}
```
