## Problem 1

**Loading in `iris` dataset with missing values**

``` r
set.seed(10)

iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))
```

#### Writing a function to replace missing values

  - missing numeric values are filled in with the mean of non-missing
    values
  - missing character values are filled in with \`“virginica”

<!-- end list -->

``` r
fix_missing = function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    replace_na(x, mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
  } else if (is.character(x)) {
  replace_na(x, "virginica")
  }
}

iris_no_missing = map_dfr(iris_with_missing, fix_missing)
```

## Problem 2

**Loading and tidying control and experimental arm data**

  - reading in all files from each subject into one dataframe
  - tidying data to include 4 columns with study arm, id, week and

<!-- end list -->

``` r
read_files = function(file) {
  study_data = read_csv(file)
}

path_base = "./data/"

join_data = 
  tibble(
    file_name = list.files(path = "./data/"),
    all_files = str_c(path_base, file_name)) %>% 
  mutate(study_data = map(all_files, read_files)) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  select(-all_files) %>% 
  separate(file_name, into = c("study_arm", "subject_id"), sep = "\\_") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8, 
    names_to = "week", 
    values_to = "observation"
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    subject_id = str_replace(subject_id, ".csv", ""),
    week = str_replace(week, "week_", ""),
    study_arm = str_replace(study_arm, "con", "control"),
    study_arm = str_replace(study_arm, "exp", "experimental")
)
```
